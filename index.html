                    <p>I consider myself to be a self-taught programmer.  I have a degree in Computer Science degree plus a 5+ years of experience in the field programming.  Had I not self-taught myself actual programming I would not be where I am today.  In fact I would probably not even be a programmer.  I started writing code around age 14.   </p>

                    <h2>My Focus</h2>
                    <p>My focus was software Web development. The code I wrote outside of class and work for fun was more evolved than in class and work.</p>
<p>Over the last year working as a developer in Zawya I’ve identified several key things that as a self-taught developer I have missed out, or actually didn't notice applying.

                    <h2>What I Understood</h2>
                    <p>As I remember from my last review I was asked to check out design patterns. My reply was that I design with my own code style. However, the patterns that I read about or came across, some of them I was actually applying but I didn't realize their name or concept.</p>
<p>It was only this year when at work things started to get more professional and advanced. I actually started learning from work more than what I taught my self. At work things became more Orderly and precise in procedures. It started with the MVC framework that actually disciplined my coding procedures, to the deployment levels and procedures that made the whole working process easier and more collaborative between technology teams and units.

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <p>Last year was rich with lots of topics as I mentioned, MVC framework, ORM, Reusability, Agile Development, Unit Testing, Deployment life cycles and procedures, and many other things I can't remember.</p>
<p>Also I had the chance to work on java for the newsletter auto mail sender, created the one for the research weekly newsletter. And I’m looking up to the moment I will be working on more advanced java stuff.

                    <p>One thing that I'm happy about is the fact that I broke the idea of trying to get like Lito or Fahad in terms of experience. I honestly see them as peers to compete with. They have the knowledge of something they had work on. And I have knowledge that they want to learn from and know. I know that I can add to there knowledge. </p>

                    <p> Funny thing that I see my self-doing is affecting people around me in terms of technology, knowledge, expertise and choices. I'm actually one of the founders of a new association that is on the verge of being born; I'm to be the technology expert for that association. I can't talk about it much now cause it is still unofficial and I might get legal problems regarding this in Lebanon Law.</p>

I will be happy with a big smile credited for 30 years. Anyway this is important for me and it is the only way.

Also I’m happy to be the most utilized person with the most accurate estimation for the year 2012, and hopefully I will remain on this mode and better.
